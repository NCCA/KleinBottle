![alt tag](http://nccastaff.bournemouth.ac.uk/jmacey/GraphicsLib/Demos/Klein.png)

This program demonstrates the production of a Klein bottle based on the code from this excellent [website](http://paulbourke.net/geometry/klein/) It uses the ngl::VertexArrayObject class


Note this branch is an older version and will not be maintained as it uses the old OpenGL widget
